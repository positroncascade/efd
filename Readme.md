# A Fixed-Grid Flow Solver for Fluid-Structure Interaction with The Coupling Library PreCICE

* The fluid motion is modeled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.
* For the temporal descritization the projection schemes are used.
* A finite-differnce on a Cartesian grid is used for the spatial descritization.
* Two- and three-dimensional scenarios are available
* The application produces Paraview-readable simulation results.
* The solver can run in series and in parallel.
